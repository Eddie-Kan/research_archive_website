## Abstract

Predicting the thermodynamic stability of perovskite crystals is essential for accelerating materials discovery. We introduce CrystalGNN, a graph neural network that encodes periodic crystal structures as multi-edge graphs with learnable angular features.

## Method

CrystalGNN represents each crystal as a graph where:
- **Nodes** correspond to atoms, featurized by element embeddings
- **Edges** represent bonds within a cutoff radius, with distance and angular features
- **Message passing** aggregates neighbor information over 3 layers

The model outputs per-atom energies that are summed and normalized to predict formation energy per atom.

## Key Results

On our curated dataset of 12,847 ABX3 perovskites:
- MAE: 0.043 eV/atom (18% improvement over CGCNN)
- R²: 0.96
- Stability classification AUC: 0.98

The model generalizes well to unseen compositions, with only a modest increase in error for out-of-distribution B-site elements.
